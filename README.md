## Deployment Architecture

### Containerization
- Each microservice runs in its own Docker container
- PostgreSQL with PostGIS in a dedicated container
- RabbitMQ in a dedicated container
- Frontend served via Nginx container
- Docker Compose for local development and testing
- Docker networks for service isolation

### Service Dependencies
- All services connect to PostgreSQL (with separate databases or schemas)
- All services connect to RabbitMQ for messaging
- Services register with Service Discovery
- API Gateway as the single entry point
- Configuration server for centralized config management

### Scalability
- Horizontal scaling of microservices
- Database connection pooling
- Caching layer (Redis) for frequently accessed data
- Load balancing at API Gateway
- Message queue for handling traffic spikes

## Development Workflow

### Local Development
1. Clone repository
2. Run Docker Compose to start infrastructure (PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ)
3. Start individual microservices
4. Start frontend development server
5. Access via API Gateway

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for service interactions
- End-to-end tests for critical user flows
- Load testing for performance validation
- Contract testing for inter-service communication

### CI/CD Pipeline
- Automated testing on commit
- Docker image building
- Container registry push
- Automated deployment to staging
- Manual approval for production
- Rollback capabilities

## Security Considerations

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- OAuth2 integration options
- API key management for admin operations

### Data Security
- Encrypted data at rest
- TLS/SSL for data in transit
- Secure payment processing (PCI compliance)
- Personal data protection (GDPR compliance)
- Database encryption
- Secure credential management

### API Security
- Rate limiting
- Request validation
- API versioning
- CORS configuration
- Input sanitization
- SQL injection prevention

## Monitoring & Observability

### Metrics
- Service health checks
- Performance metrics
- Business metrics (bookings, revenue)
- Error rates
- Response times

### Logging
- Centralized logging
- Structured logging format
- Log aggregation
- Log retention policies
- Searchable logs

### Tracing
- Distributed tracing
- Request correlation IDs
- Performance bottleneck identification
- Service dependency mapping

## PostGIS Use Cases

### Location-Based Operations
- Finding available vehicles within radius
- Service area boundary checking
- Route distance calculations
- Geofencing for restricted zones
- Heat maps for demand analysis
- Optimal vehicle distribution
- Driver proximity matching

### Spatial Queries
- Point in polygon (is user in service area?)
- Distance calculations
- Nearest vehicle search
- Coverage area optimization
- Location-based pricing zones

## Business Logic Highlights

### Booking Flow (Without Driver)
1. User searches for vehicles by location
2. System shows available vehicles with pricing
3. User selects vehicle and time slot
4. System validates availability
5. System calculates price
6. User confirms and makes payment
7. Booking confirmed, vehicle reserved
8. User receives pickup instructions
9. User unlocks vehicle at pickup time
10. Usage tracking begins
11. User returns vehicle and locks
12. System calculates final charges
13. Transaction completed

### Booking Flow (With Driver)
1. User searches for vehicles with driver option
2. System shows available vehicles and drivers
3. User selects vehicle, driver preference, and time
4. System assigns suitable driver
5. System calculates price (including driver fee)
6. User confirms and makes payment
7. Driver notified and accepts
8. User and driver connected
9. Driver picks up user at specified location
10. Journey tracking
11. Driver completes journey
12. User rates driver and vehicle
13. Transaction completed

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2 Features
